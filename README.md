# Dice-Duel-Project
Dice Duel is a fun and interactive web-based dice game where two players compete to see who rolls the higher number. Each player gets a randomly generated dice roll upon refreshing the page, with the winner dynamically displayed. Perfect for quick fun and to learn the basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design.
